Brick Breaker (platformer) is a Breakout clone which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. <br>The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the BlackBerry's trackwheel, the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger (in the case of touchscreen).<br> The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. <br>When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. There are 3 levels. If all lives are lost, the game is over. <br>There are many versions of brick breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up.<br>
Three levels of game:<br>
Easy level:<br>
Three layers of static bricks with single ball. Player wins the level if all the
bricks are cleared. Speed of the ball is slow.<br>
Medium level:<br>
Bricks will gradually come down and the paddle size is relatively smaller
than easy level. Player loses the game as the brick touches the bottom of the
screen.<br> Player wins the level if all the bricks are cleared before they touch
the paddle.<br>
Hard level:<br>
Bricks will gradually come down and the paddle size is relatively smaller
than medium level. Number of balls is two and the speed of the ball is
increased.<br>
Three lives for each level
